=============
Dewar Scanner
=============

An Android app for scanning Dewar's ISPyB shipping label.

Using this app, a Dewar can be registered as ``arrived`` or ``leaving`` in the `ISPyB <https://ispyb.github.io/ISPyB/>`_ system.
The Dewars are registed by scanning the shipping label's barcode.
This app supports the barcodes generated by the ISPyB system deployed at MAXIV facility.

The app is using Android's devices camera to scan the barcode.
It does not require any external hardware, and thus should work on any Android device with a camera.

Note that the app is hardcoded to work with the ISPyB system at MAXIV and BioMAX beamline.
However, it should be fairly straight forward to add support for other facilities and beamlines.
